### File Streams:

## Type of streams for files
	
	ofstream - This data type represents the output file stream and is used to create files and to write 
	           information to files.

	ifstream - This data type represents the input file stream and is used to read information from files.

	fstream  - This data type represents the file stream generally, and has the capabilities of both 
	           ofstream and ifstream which means it can create files, write information to files, and read 
	           information from files.

	ios::app   - Append mode. All output to that file to be appended to the end.
	ios::ate   - Open a file for output and move the read/write control to the end of the file.
	ios::in    - Open a file for reading.
	ios::out   - Open a file for writing.
	ios::trunc - If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated before opening the file.
